x266 - open H.266 codec software & hardware implementation
==========================================

x266 is an open source highly optimal software/hardware co-design architecture implementation of the next generation H.266 video codec.

It is demonstration research of industrialized implement video coding H.266. as soon as H.266 specification release, I will publishing my industrialize H.266 codec.

x266 based on Software/Hardware Cooperative concept and flexible task distributed and resource reuse architecture.
